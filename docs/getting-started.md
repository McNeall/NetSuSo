# Getting Started

Create a board using one of the provided methods on the `Board` class. See the documentation for an overview off all
the methods.

```c#
int[] values = [
        0, 5, 0, 7, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0,
        0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0,
        0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0,
        0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0,
        0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,
        7, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 6,
        9, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4,
        8, 4, 0, 5, 7, 2, 0, 9, 3,
        0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0
];
Board board = Board.FromEnumerable(values);
```

Create a solver providing the board:

```c#
BasicSolver solver = new BasicSolver(board);
```

Call the `Solve` method to search for a valid solution:

```c#
solver.Solve();
```

Full example including imports:

```c#
using NetSuSo;

int[] values = [
        0, 5, 0, 7, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0,
        0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0,
        0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0,
        0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0,
        0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,
        7, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 6,
        9, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4,
        8, 4, 0, 5, 7, 2, 0, 9, 3,
        0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0
];
Board board = Board.FromEnumerable(values);
BasicSolver solver = new BasicSolver(board);
solver.Solve();
Console.WriteLine(board.UnicodeRepresentation());
```
